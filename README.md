# Every Float
[Open it up!](https://1e1001.github.io/every-float)

Every IEEE-754 binary32 float in a single web page, because I wanted to try messing around with an &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; scrolling setup.

Not binary64 because unfortunately there&rsquo;s a limit to how large an element can be, so I can&rsquo;t make a 2&sup3;&sup2; &times; 2&sup3;&sup2; entry long page. That&rsquo;s also why even this a two-dimensional table instead of a long list.
